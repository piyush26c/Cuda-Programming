# High-Performance Computing with CUDA

Welcome to the repository of my CUDA projects developed during my Bachelor's course in 410241: High-Performance Computing (HPC). This repository contains a collection of CUDA code implementations focusing on parallel computing techniques and algorithms. Through these projects, I learned and applied various concepts of parallel computing to solve complex computational problems efficiently.

## Overview

This repository includes CUDA code for the following tasks:

1. **Computing Statistical Measures**:
   - Minimum
   - Maximum
   - Standard Deviation
   - Mean
   - Mode
   - Median

2. **Vector Operations**:
   - Vector Addition

3. **Matrix Operations**:
   - Matrix Multiplication

## Features

- **Parallel Computing**: Utilize the power of CUDA to execute operations in parallel, significantly reducing computation time for large datasets.
- **Optimization**: Implement optimized algorithms to achieve high performance and efficient memory usage.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale data with improved computational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA Toolkit installed
- Basic understanding of C/C++ programming
